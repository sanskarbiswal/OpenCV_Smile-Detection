# OpenCV_Smile-Detection
Simple Smile Detection using OpenCV and Python

The primary objective of the current project is to detect smile of th user using haar_cascade dataset provided and distributed with OpenCV.
The present project only detects smiles from the front profile of the user. The sensitivity of expression can be set in the file *main.py*, at *line 53*. The threshold value can be from anywhere between 3 (very sensitive) to 6 (almost no output).
